<h2>A few words about me</h2>
<p>With over 20 years of experience as a senior full-stack software engineer, I have a strong track record of problem solving and innovation.
While often referred to as an IT expert, I see myself as a self-motivated developer who proactively seeks opportunities for growth, both in my own skills and in the products I work on, without being pushed.
I am very detail-oriented and enjoy designing system architectures that are pragmatic rather than overly theoretical. I take a user-centered approach, thinking critically about products as if I were the end user, continuously refining and improving the UX. Passionate about technology and my work, I'm dedicated to delivering results efficiently - while I don't mind putting in extra hours when necessary, I usually complete tasks within standard working hours.
Although I have management experience, my true passion lies in hands-on product development, where I explore and implement innovative, out-of-the-box solutions.
I don't just code to specifications - I dive deep to understand processes, identify opportunities for optimization, and build systems that deliver real business value.</p>
<h2>Professional skills highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>PHP, JavaScript</b>, TypeScript;</li>
</ul>
<!-- - A bit of Go, Ruby and Python; -->
<ul>
<li><b>Laravel</b>, Symfony, <b>Inertia, Livewire</b>, HTMX;</li>
<li>
<!--React, --><b>Vue.js, Alpine.js, Tailwind CSS</b>;
</li>
<li>OOP, Design Patterns, SOLID, DRY, KISS principles;</li>
<li>Pest/PHPUnit, Larastan/PHPStan - Test coverage, stat analysts;</li>
<li>Laravel Horizon, Laravel Reverb, Laravel Scout, Laravel Spark, Laravel Nova &amp; Filament;</li>
<li>MySQL, PostgreSQL, SingleStore, MS-SQL, SQLite;</li>
<li>Mongo, Redis, Memcached;</li>
<li>Laravel Cloud, Laravel Vapor, Laravel Forge, Laravel Envoyer;</li>
<li>AWS, Hetzner Cloud, DigitalOcean, Vultr, Linode;</li>
<li>Laravel Octane, Swoole, FrankenPHP;</li>

<li>Messaging Gateway Solutions: SMS and Email;</li>
<li>Security &amp; Compliance Measures: electronic digital signatures, two-factor auth, SSL protocols, comprehensive data protection, and access control systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a full-stack developer with slightly more of a back-end focus, I prefer to build <b>APIs or &quot;modern monolith&quot; full-stack applications</b> on top of Laravel framework using progressive technologies like Inertia.js and Livewire to <b>reduce the overhead of front-end routing and state management</b> until it is really needed. This helps to <b>significantly reduce time to market and maintenance</b> while still providing great performance and extensibility. I always use static analysis tools like PHPStan (Larastan) and cover the code I write with tests using PHPUnit (Pest). I have extensive experience building and scaling high-load systems with millions of active users and background jobs, from system design to fine tuning.</p>

<h2>Additional info</h2>
<p>For the past 7+ years, I've been based in South East Asia, primarily in Bali, Indonesia and Phuket, Thailand. This unique living experience has been some transformative both personally and professionally. The mild climate and welcoming community have been instrumental in maintaining a healthy work-life balance; immersing myself in new cultures and learning new languages has been an incredible opportunity that has helped me to expand my cognitive flexibility and enhance my professional adaptability.
Prior to my international move, I was actively involved in the Kazakhstan market with several notable professional achievements. I organized product and service promotion workshops, wrote articles for local magazines, and served as an information technology consultant. I also participated in the development of over twenty web applications for both public and intranet systems, which were successfully marketed and sold.

As an active member of the youth automotive community, I pursued my hobby by helping to organize city and national drag racing competitions from 2002 to 2007. However, after my first visit to Europe in 2007, traveling became my new passion.</p>
