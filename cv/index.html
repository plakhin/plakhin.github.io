<h2>Few words about myself</h2>
<p>Over 20 years experienced Senior Full-stack Software Engineer, I have a strong track record of problem-solving and innovation.
While often mentioned as an IT expert, I see myself as a self-motivated developer who proactively seeks opportunities for growth, both in my own skills and in the products I work on without being pushed.
I am highly detail-oriented and enjoy designing system architectures, though I remain pragmatic rather than overly theoretical. I take a user-centric approach, thinking critically about products as if I were the end user, continuously refining and enhancing the user experience. Passionate about technology and my work, I am dedicated to delivering results efficiently — while I don't mind to put in extra hours when necessary, I typically complete tasks within standard working hours.
Although I have managerial experience, my true passion lies in hands-on product development, where I explore and implement innovative, unconventional solutions.
I don't just code to specifications — I dive deep into understanding business processes, identifying opportunities for optimization, and delivering systems that bring real business value.</p>

</ul>
<p>Being a full-stack developer with more focus on back end, I prefer to build <b>APIs or &quot;modern monolith&quot; full stack applications</b> on the top of Laravel framework using progressive technologies like Inertia.js and Livewire to <b>reduce the overhead front-end routing and state management produces</b> until it is really required. This helps to <b>significantly reduce time to market and requires less effort for maintenance still providing the great performance and extensibility</b>. I have extensive experience In building and scaling high-load systems with millions of active users and background jobs starting from system design and including precise fine-tuning.</p>

This unique living experience has been some transformative both personally and professionally. The mild climate and welcoming community have significantly contributed to maintaining a healthy work-life balance; immersing myself in new cultures and learning new languages has been an incredible opportunity helping me to expand my cognitive flexibility and enhance my professional adaptability.
Prior to my international move, I was actively involved in the Kazakhstan market with several notable professional achievements. I organized workshops focusing on product and service promotion, contributed articles to local magazines, and served as a consultant in information technology. I was also involved in development of over twenty web applications for both public and intranet systems which were successfully marketed and sold.
